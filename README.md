Key Generator for Encryption Algorithms</h3>



















</div>








This Python script allows users to generate cryptographic keys for two popular encryption algorithms: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Data Encryption Standard (DES). The user can choose the desired algorithm, and the script generates a random key for that algorithm, converts it to hexadecimal format, and saves it to a text file.

Usage:

- Run the script.
- Choose between AES and DES encryption.
- The script generates a random key, converts it to hex, and saves it to a file.

Designed for use with Tait Key Utility to make it easier to generate keys on the fly.
